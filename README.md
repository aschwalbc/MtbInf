# MtbInf:

### Estimating the global burden of viable *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* Infection

This repository contains the code and data used to estimate the global burden of viable *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) infection.

### Repository Structure

-   `data/`: Contains input data files, including ARI estimates and demographic information.

-   `scripts/`: R scripts used for data processing, modelling, and analysis.

-   `outputs/`: Generated outputs such as figures and summary tables.

-   `MtbInf.Rproj`: R project file for easy navigation and project management.

### Usage

The outputs generated from the analysis include:

-   Estimates of the number of individuals recently infected with viable *Mtb*.

-   Age-specific and regional breakdowns of infection burden.

-   Visualisations illustrating the distribution and trends of viable *Mtb* infection.
